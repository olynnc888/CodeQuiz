##Project Title
Challenge 4 Coding Quiz

##Description
Created a coding quiz with a high score page from scratch.

##Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over

##What was done to meet criteria
I utilized variables, if else variables, if else statements, queeryselctor, and event listeners to be able to create clear peramiters. I also created HTML and CSS elements.
